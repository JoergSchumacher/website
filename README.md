# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*](https:///www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the greatest beginner Git tutorial in the history of the Universe. It's so incomplete - by design - that you have to learn something to get along.

After finishing *Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.
